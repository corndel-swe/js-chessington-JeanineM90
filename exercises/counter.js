// Make your Counter class here

class Counter {
    constructor(count) {
        this.count = 0
    }
}

// Replace `null` with an _instance_ of your counter
const counterInstance = new Counter()

// Please don't change the lines below!
export { Counter, counterInstance }

/*
- create a new class called `Counter`: Make sure your class name has a capital `C`
- Give it a constructor that initialises `count` to `0`
- Assign the variable `counterInstance` to an instance of your counter
      class.

      Tech Docs:
      To create an instance from this blueprint (class), we use the "new" keyword 

The count didn't work initially as I didn't use "this."
